# TypeScript Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.  The error arises when a function expects a numerical input but receives a string instead. This often happens due to incorrect parameter types in function calls or type mismatches during variable assignments.

The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ts` shows the corrected version with type checking and error handling.
